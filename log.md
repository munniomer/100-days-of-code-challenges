# 100 Days Of Code - Log [Munira Omar]

### Day 1: February 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: started the Responsive web design certification on Freecodecamp and Finished the Basic HTML and HTML5 challenges.

**Thoughts**: I started the freecodecamp earlier but always left in the middle but am happy to restart it to and focus on finishing it no matter what happens.
